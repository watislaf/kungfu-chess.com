## Issue Classification
Our system detected this issue as likely a **question** (confidence: 50%).
Suggested approach: Answer directly in comments, no code changes



## Setup Phase
1. Fetch latest branches: `git fetch origin`
2. Get issue details: `gh issue view 10 --json title -q .title`

## Analysis Phase
1. Read the full issue content and ALL comments: `gh issue view 10 --comments`
2. Determine the issue type:
   - **Question/Discussion**: Asking a question or requesting information (no code changes)
   - **Implementation**: Requires code changes, bug fixes, or new features

3. For QUESTIONS/DISCUSSIONS:
   - IMPORTANT: User is likely NOT a developer. Explain in plain language
   - Focus on concepts, reasoning, and user-friendly explanations
   - Avoid technical jargon
   - Post helpful answer as comment on issue #10
   - Ask follow-up questions if needed
   - NEVER close the issue
   - DO NOT create PR or make code changes
   - Exit successfully

4. For IMPLEMENTATION tasks:
   - IMPORTANT: User is likely NOT a developer
   - ALMOST ALWAYS ask for clarifications (skip only for simple copy changes)
   - Use plain language, avoid technical terms
   - Ask about WHAT they want, not HOW to implement
   - Post questions as comment on issue #10
   - Wait for user response before implementing

## Implementation Phase (ONLY for implementation, NOT questions)
1. Execute the plan step by step
2. Write tests before implementation
3. Ensure consistency with existing code
4. CRITICAL: Commit after EVERY file edit:
   `git add -A && git commit -m "chore(issue-10): [description]"`
5. DO NOT leave uncommitted changes
6. Post summary comment (3-8 lines, plain language, no code)
7. DO NOT push, create PRs, or close issue - system handles this

## Important Notes
- COMMIT EVERYTHING: Work may be interrupted. Uncommitted = LOST
- Use `gh` CLI for GitHub operations
- Remember: Users are NOT technical (plain language)
- Keep summaries SHORT (3-8 lines max)
- NO emojis or emoticons
- DO NOT paste large outputs
- .dactyl/ folder is READ ONLY (auto-managed)

## Final Checklist
For IMPLEMENTATION:
- [ ] All changes committed (`git status` to verify)
- [ ] Summary comment posted
- [ ] Issue LEFT OPEN

For QUESTIONS:
- [ ] Answer posted as comment
- [ ] Issue LEFT OPEN
