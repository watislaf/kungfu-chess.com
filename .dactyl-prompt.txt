## Issue Classification
Our system detected this issue as likely a **bug** (confidence: 100%).
Suggested approach: Analyze root cause, write tests first, fix issue



## Setup Phase
1. Fetch latest branches: `git fetch origin`
2. Get issue details: `gh issue view 32 --json title -q .title`

## Analysis Phase
1. Read the full issue content and ALL comments: `gh issue view 32 --comments`
2. Determine the issue type:
   - **Question/Discussion**: Asking a question or requesting information (no code changes)
   - **Implementation**: Requires code changes, bug fixes, or new features

3. For QUESTIONS/DISCUSSIONS:
   - IMPORTANT: User is likely NOT a developer. Explain in plain language
   - Focus on concepts, reasoning, and user-friendly explanations
   - Avoid technical jargon
   - Post helpful answer as comment on issue #32
   - Ask follow-up questions if needed
   - NEVER close the issue
   - DO NOT create PR or make code changes
   - Exit successfully

4. For IMPLEMENTATION tasks:
   - IMPORTANT: User is likely NOT a developer
   - ALMOST ALWAYS ask for clarifications (skip only for simple copy changes)
   - Use plain language, avoid technical terms
   - Ask about WHAT they want, not HOW to implement
   
   **If you need clarification:**
   - Post your questions as a comment on issue #32
   - DO NOT make any code changes yet
   - DO NOT proceed to Implementation Phase
   - Exit successfully (system will re-trigger when user responds)
   
   **If the task is clear and straightforward:**
   - Proceed directly to Implementation Phase
   - You can ask follow-up questions while implementing if needed

## Implementation Phase (ONLY when task is clear)
**IMPORTANT:** Only proceed here if:
- You understand exactly what the user wants, OR
- The task is simple and obvious, OR
- You've already asked questions in a previous conversation

**If you just asked questions above, EXIT NOW. Do not implement yet.**

1. Execute the plan step by step
2. Write tests before implementation (if applicable)
3. Ensure consistency with existing code
4. CRITICAL: Commit after EVERY file edit:
   `git add -A && git commit -m "chore(issue-32): [description]"`
5. DO NOT leave uncommitted changes
6. DO NOT commit housekeeping changes (like .gitignore) unless that's the issue
7. Post summary comment (3-8 lines, plain language, no code)
8. DO NOT push, create PRs, or close issue - system handles this

## Important Notes
- COMMIT EVERYTHING: Work may be interrupted. Uncommitted = LOST
- Use `gh` CLI for GitHub operations
- Remember: Users are NOT technical (plain language)
- Keep summaries SHORT (3-8 lines max)
- NO emojis or emoticons
- DO NOT paste large outputs
- .dactyl/ folder is READ ONLY (auto-managed, already in .gitignore)
- DO NOT commit .dactyl/ files (they're ignored automatically)

## Final Checklist
For IMPLEMENTATION (when you made code changes):
- [ ] All changes committed (`git status` to verify)
- [ ] Changes actually address the issue (not just housekeeping)
- [ ] Summary comment posted
- [ ] Issue LEFT OPEN

For QUESTIONS/CLARIFICATIONS (when you need more info):
- [ ] Questions posted as comment
- [ ] NO code changes made
- [ ] NO commits made
- [ ] Issue LEFT OPEN
- [ ] Exited successfully (system will re-trigger on user reply)

For DISCUSSION ANSWERS (explaining how things work):
- [ ] Answer posted as comment
- [ ] Issue LEFT OPEN
